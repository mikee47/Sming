Features
========

There are multiple custom features that can be enabled by default. For
example: SSL support, custom LWIP, open PWM, custom heap allocation,
more verbose debugging, etc.

The features available are dependent upon the architecture for which Sming is being built.

* All architectures: :doc:`/_inc/Sming/README`
